3 game modes to determine legnth of race course

User is turtle, a focus-based animal
Computer is rabbit, a speed-based animal

Rather than let users directly manipulate stats,
Variables that positively or negatively affects user and com stats: Name, Speed, & Focus

Course variable: 2 courses that affect user and com stats

Coinflip: 50% chance for each course

If rabbit is leading at halfway point, user/turtle speed increases

If turtle is leading at halfway point, com/rabbit focus increases

2 Endings: Win & Lose

Prompt user to play again
